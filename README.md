A simple project of a game called 'Flappy Bird' in my version. It's for desktop and mobile devices also.

## How to play:

1. Just click the start button. 

2. After that you need to click on the screen of the game to jump and dodge the spikes/fences.

3. Get points each time when you are dodging the spikes.
